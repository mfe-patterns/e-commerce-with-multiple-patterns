        "Its really good quality must buy. Colour is as per the picture and its washable. Stays really as it is",
        "Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.",

        "best good product prive battry camera all very good",
        "Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.",
        "Let us make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing"
